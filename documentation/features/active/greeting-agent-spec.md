# Greeting Agent Technical Specification

**Document Name:** Greeting Agent Implementation Plan
**Date:** September 26, 2025
**Version:** 0.1.0
**Status:** Active

## Executive Summary
Create a minimal Google ADK agent that collects the end user's name during a conversation and responds with a personalized greeting.

## Architecture Overview
- Use `google.adk.agents.LlmAgent` as the root agent with a single-turn conversational loop driven by Gemini.
- Configure the agent with a concise instruction that ensures it requests the user's name when unknown and greets them once known.
- Provide a thin runner utility that supports console-based interaction for local testing.

## Implementation Phases
1. Repository scaffolding: add a `src/` package and establish time-saving utilities for agent configuration.
2. Agent execution path: implement the greeting agent factory, runner entry point, and environment loading for API keys.
3. Validation: run a console smoke test to confirm the agent asks for the user's name and greets them correctly.

## Test Plan
- Manual console interaction using the runner to verify prompting for the name and greeting response.
- (Future) Unit coverage that mocks the LLM call path to ensure deterministic greeting logic.

## Security Considerations
- Load Gemini API keys from environment variables using `python-dotenv` to avoid hardcoding secrets.
- Do not log raw API keys or sensitive user inputs.
